                We are a group of people who have come together to help businesses recruit, engage, hire, and retain the talent they need to grow and flourish. We believe in equal opportunity for all and realize that it is our ongoing responsibility to address the conscious and unconscious personal and structural prejudices that create unequal playing fields. As individuals and as a group, we are dedicated to creating an environment that welcomes, motivates, and inspires.Â
